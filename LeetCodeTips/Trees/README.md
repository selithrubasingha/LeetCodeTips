# Trees

- The first few question is some basic questions that don't need no explanation 

## Invert Binary Tree

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* invertTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return nullptr;

        TreeNode* tmp = root->left;
        root->left = root->right;
        root->right = tmp;

        invertTree(root->left);
        invertTree(root->right);

        return root;
        
    }
};
```
